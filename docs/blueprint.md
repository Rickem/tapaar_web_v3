## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong, lively purple (#703BE3) to evoke modernity and energy in the UI. A direct response to the user's color input of #335ae3 but enhanced with a more saturated hue to avoid a business-app feel.
- Background color: Very light purple (#F2EEFA), creating a soft, consistent backdrop, for comfortable readability
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#E3973B), a more controlled echo of the user's color request for #f8a046, will ensure key interactive elements like calls to action really pop without clashing or overpowering the layout
- Body text and Headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for a modern and slightly warm appearance, suitable for UI.
- Use flat, vector-based icons with rounded corners, in the primary and accent colors to represent actions and categories, enhancing the 'game-like interface'.
- Employ a card-based layout for the dashboard, providing clear, distinct sections for TapaarPoints balance, quick actions, and recent transactions. Mobile-first responsive design.
- Incorporate subtle animations for point increases, completed tasks, and dashboard updates, creating a satisfying and engaging user experience.
